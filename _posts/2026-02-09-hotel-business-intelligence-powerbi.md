## Project Overview

This project delivers an executive-level Hotel Performance Dashboard built in Power BI to provide clear visibility into revenue performance, occupancy trends, pricing effectiveness, and room utilization.

The objective was to transform structured hospitality data into a centralized decision-support system that enables proactive operational and strategic decision-making.

---

## Business Challenge

Hotel management requires consolidated insight into:

- Revenue performance drivers  
- Occupancy patterns across time  
- Pricing effectiveness (ADR & RevPAR)  
- Room category profitability  
- Seasonal demand fluctuations  

Without integrated analytics, decisions are reactive and fragmented. This dashboard addresses that gap by aligning financial and operational KPIs into a single performance view.

## Analytical Approach

The solution was built using a structured data model optimized for performance and scalability.

Key components included:

- Cleaned and transformed booking datasets  
- Implemented a star schema data model  
- Developed dynamic KPIs using DAX  
- Built time-based and comparative performance metrics  

The focus was not on technical complexity, but on delivering reliable, decision-ready metrics.

## 📊 Dashboard Design & Executive Insights

The dashboard provides executive-level visibility into hotel performance by combining financial and operational KPIs in a single decision-ready interface. It enables stakeholders to:

- Monitor revenue, ADR, RevPAR, and occupancy in real time  
- Identify seasonal demand shifts and revenue fluctuations  
- Compare room category profitability and utilization  
- Analyze performance across cities, time periods, and room classes using interactive filters  

The design prioritizes clarity, comparability, and actionable insight rather than visual complexity.

## Key Insights

- Revenue fluctuations are strongly influenced by pricing strategy, not occupancy alone  
- Certain room categories consistently outperform others in profitability  
- Seasonal demand patterns highlight clear optimization windows  
- Low-demand periods present targeted promotional opportunities  
- Time-based KPI monitoring enables proactive resource planning  

---

## Outcome

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Structure analytical models for performance and scalability  
- Develop meaningful KPIs aligned to business objectives  
- Translate raw operational data into executive-level insight  

The result is a scalable Business Intelligence solution that supports informed decision-making within the hospitality industry.
