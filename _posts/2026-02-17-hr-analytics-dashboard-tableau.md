# HR Analytics Dashboard – Tableau

**Project Overview**  
This project demonstrates an **interactive HR dashboard** I built in Tableau using a dataset of **8,950 employee records**. The goal was to provide both **executive-level workforce insights** and **employee-level drill-down analysis**, enabling HR teams to make informed, data-driven decisions.

**Problem Solved**  
Organizations often struggle to get a clear view of workforce trends, demographics, and compensation patterns. This dashboard consolidates key HR metrics in a single platform, allowing leadership to:  

- Monitor workforce size and growth trends  
- Assess demographic composition and age distribution  
- Evaluate salary structures and alignment with roles  
- Track employee tenure, retention, and departmental distribution  

**Key Insights**  
- Total Hired: 8,950; Active: 7,984; Terminated: 966  
- Workforce is concentrated in Operations, Sales, and Customer Service  
- Gender distribution is balanced; age 35–44 is the largest group  
- Salary increases with experience, education, and seniority  
- Strong retention among employees hired 2016–2019  
- New York headquarters dominates, with structured presence across other states
